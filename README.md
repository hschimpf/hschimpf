## About me

Hi! 🖖 I'm Hermann D. Schimpf, a full-stack developer born on Argentina, currently living in Paraguay.

- I have passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with everyone.
- Some of my hobbies are gaming and photography.
- I've been programming since the 5th grade of elementary school. I made my first game in QBasic and a chat app in
  VisualBasic 6.0.

## My Tech Stack and daily tools

- **PHP**, where using `==` instead of `===` can turn a simple comparison into an adventure worthy of Indiana Jones.
- **TypeScript**, making sure you spend more time writing type definitions than actual code.
- **Laravel**, because why write ten lines of code when one artisan command can do it all.
- **MySQL**, where optimizing queries feels like a never-ending quest to find the mythical index that will unlock
  ultimate performance.
- **Pest**, where 'test-driven development' becomes 'bug-driven extinction'.
- **Vite**, because waiting for your code to build is so last-century.
- **Bootstrap**, to ensure that all websites look the same, because who needs creativity when you can have uniformity?
- **AWS**, the cloud giant that seems all-powerful until you encounter its impenetrable documentation.
- **serverless**, the magic of cloud computing, where servers are like mythical creatures you know they exist, but you
  can't see them.
- **Bref**, when you thought PHP couldn't get any cooler, it starts doing backflips in the cloud.
- **git**, the grand master of merge conflicts, teaching developers the art of conflict resolution since ages.
- **composer**, where updating dependencies is like stepping on a minefield, and you pray it won't explode your entire
  project.
- **npm**, to have more packages than presents Santa delivers on Christmas Eve.
- **xdebug**, where debugging feels like a game of whack-a-mole—every time you fix one bug, two more pop up.
- **Insomnia**, because clicking _"Send"_ to test APIs is much cooler than using `curl`.
- **PHPStorm**, when _'Indexing...'_ takes longer than a Game of Thrones season.

### Currently, learning more about

- Vite
- Pest
- CI/CD

## Some of my work

### [Parallel SDK](https://github.com/hschimpf/parallel-sdk)

A library that allows you to execute long-running tasks in parallel in PHP.
The library provides a simple and easy-to-use way to schedule tasks to run in parallel, track the progress of tasks, and
handle errors that occur during task execution.

The library is a wrapper around [krakjoe/parallel](https://github.com/krakjoe/parallel) extension and is designed to
work even if the `parallel` extension isn't available.

### [Bancard SDK](https://github.com/hschimpf/bancard-sdk)

A library to integrate the [vPOS](https://www.bancard.com.py/vpos)
and [VentasQR](https://comercios.bancard.com.py/productos/ventas-qr) products of [Bancard](https://www.bancard.com.py/)
_(a Paraguayan payment processing company)_.
The library provides a simple and easy-to-use way to create and process Bancard payments.
